Transcription:
in the beginning 
 God created the Heaven and the Earth 
 and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground 
 and breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life 
 and Man became a living soul 
 I am the Lord thy God Thou shalt have no other gods before me 
 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want 
 he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leads me beside the still water 
 he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake 
 yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil
